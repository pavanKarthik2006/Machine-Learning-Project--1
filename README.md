System Threat Forecaster: ML-based Malware Prediction using Telemetry Data
A lightweight machine learning project to forecast potential malware threats on a system using telemetry data such as process usage, network activity, and system behavior logs. This project aims to demonstrate how telemetry-driven threat intelligence can be automated with supervised ML models.


ðŸ“Š Dataset
Synthetic or open-source telemetry datasets (e.g., Microsoft Malware Prediction on Kaggle)
